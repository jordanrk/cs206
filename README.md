Hello, and welcome to the project: Examining the Influence of Russian Bots in the 2016 election, produced as a part of CS206: Exploring Computational Journalism, under the direction of Krishna Bharat, R.B. Brenner, and Maneesh Agrawala.

This repository is meant to shed light on how we went about producing the conclusion at which we arrived. 

There are two folders: retweet analysis, and hashtag analysis. 

In retweet analysis, we use retweets as a proxy for influence, and we examine how often humans retweet bots, how often bots retweet each other, and how the time to the first retweet correlates with overall number of retweets. 

In hashtag analysis, we attempt to filter hashtags from the 1% dataset published by Twitter, as well as the IRA dataset, which is linked in the file header of Hashtag Analysis/get_hashtag_times_ira.py.
